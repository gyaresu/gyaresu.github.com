Hi. Thanks for taking the time to read my resum√©.

I have moved permanently to Oslo. I live here with my beautiful girlfriend.

I will have my British Passport by 30 July 2012. 
Until then I can invoice for work via PayPal or direct deposit into my Australian bank account.
I am even happy to work with delayed wages until I get my passport and can register with UDI.

I am very experienced across many technologies due to running my own on-site business for 8 years.

I have never found a problem I couldn't solve.

I am a very friendly and approachable person. I have an excellent manor whilst dealing with clients.

Obviously it's not in my interest to be humble in a cover letter but please realise that I appreciate
how arrogant that may sound.

I am happy doing any kind of work and any kind of hours.

What's most important to me is working with fun passionate people.

I hope that sounds like your organisation.

Thanks again and please don't hesitate to call.

Regards

Gareth
