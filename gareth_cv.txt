Personal:
 - Although I finished college (yr 12) I have led a life with the benefits of
   diverse experiences and skills. I am self taught in most things.
 - I am able to communicate effectively with diverse types of people.
 - I have a 'Just In Time' method of working where I keep current with
   technology but learn what I need as required.
 - I believe most computer problems need to be defined by what one is
   attempting to achieve than by how to fix what's broken (unable to see the
   forest for the trees). More often than not there is a way around rather than through.
 - I'm diligent because I only work at things I'm passionate about. Every day
   has aspects that are a drag but that won't deter you if you're there for
   the right reasons. I haven't had a job I didn't feel this way about since the mid 90's.
 - Lots more to say, let's do Skype & coffee.
