Previous Employment:

Computer Rescue / Ninja Web Development: Owner (2002 - 2010) http://computerrescue.com.au
 - On-site support for individuals and businesses.
 - I started this business with nothing but self education and a promise to quit if I sucked.
 - Eight years later I sold the business to my excellent employee and count my blessings for the amazing years of experiences that helped build my troubleshooting skills in so many directions.

Skills: 
 - Windows, Linux (Debian, CentOS), Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, TCP/IP, shell scripting, Python, JavaScript, Hardware, Mobile Apps, Security, Network Protocols, many CMS.

 - Computer networking, building, repairs.
 - Troubleshooting: My favourite skill set.
 - Car & motorcycle licenses. Scuba diving instructor. Senior first aid.

Personal:
 - Although I finished college (yr 12) I have led a fairly non-average life with the benefits of diverse experiences and skills. I am a keen reader and researcher.
 - I am able to communicate effectively with diverse groups of people.
 - I have a 'Just In Time' method of working where I keep current with technology but learn what I need as required.
 - I believe most computer problems need to be defined by what one is attempting to achieve than by how to fix what's broken (unable to see the forest for the trees). More often than not there is a way around rather than through.
 - I'm diligent because I only work at things I'm passionate about. Every day has aspects that are a drag but that won't deter you if you're there for the right reasons. I haven't had a job I didn't feel this way about since the mid 90's.
 - Lots more to say, let's do Skype & coffee.
