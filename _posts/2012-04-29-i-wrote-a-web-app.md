I've been teaching myself JavaScript and Python for the last six months and thought now was a good time to open up my private repository hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com).

I've started with a fresh repo as my original private repo had too many keys & mess in it.

[Github repo: Oslo Gigs](https://github.com/gyaresu/oslogigs-node)

You can see the working version here [http://oslogigs.com](http://oslogigs.com)

It's a web app for finding the price of Ã¸l (beer) in pubs and venues around Oslo, Norway.

It uses a Google map with numbered markers. 

I intend to continue on it and hopefully add http://twillio.com authentication via sms so that the site is fully automated for price updates.

So if you're in Oslo and find the price either missing or wrong, let me know.
