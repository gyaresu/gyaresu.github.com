I've completed my OS rebuild now with the configuration of [IRSSI](http://www.irssi.org/).

Edited config and theme from [https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/dot-files/tree/master/irssi](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/dot-files/tree/master/irssi).

There was no clear channel indicator so I added `prompt = "%c$* >>%n ";` in the file `.irssi/my.theme`.
