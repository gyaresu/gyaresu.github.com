[Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) is an excellent 'cruft free' note taking app. It doesn't hurt that it's Free Software either.

NV syncronises via either [Dropbox](https://github.com/scrod/nv/wiki/synchronizing-with-dropbox) or [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/).

To keep the formatting for your notes the same accross all installs of NV you will need to turn on 'soft tabs' (converts tabs to spaces) as well as setting a 'fixed width' font.

This is due to Simplenote defaulting to stripping out tab's in favour of soft tabs.

I can [recommend](/hacking/2012/07/03/tmux-and-vim-powerline/) the [patched Mensch Regular](https://gist.github.com/qrush/1595572) font.
