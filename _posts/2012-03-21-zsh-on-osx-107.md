{% include JB/setup %}

Installed the latest version of zsh via [Macports](http://macports.org).

Setup of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) involves cloning the Github repo, picking a theme and choosing which plugins to use.

oh-my-zsh automatically checks for updates and pulls new versions.

The plugins are excellent. Rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc. 

And zsh as usual is fantastic. Just use it to find out why.

You'll never want to go back to bash after using it.
