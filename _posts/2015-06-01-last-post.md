The new top level domains (TLD's) have been a long time coming and while I will hold on to `gareth.com.au` (Company, Australia) & `gyaresu.org` (Organisation) it seems fitting to use a new domain as a symbolic break from the past and launchpad for new adventures.

You can find my new website hosted at [https://gareth.codes][gcodes]

My username everywhere on the internet is gyaresu (ギャレス) because I was studying Japanese at the time of my internet birth.

`gyaresu san` is the Japanese representation of `Gareth` plus the common [honorific][honorific] `san`. It's hard to pronounce for anyone unaquainted with [Nihongo][Nihongo] so I'll leave this audio file here to help you out:
