<p>So apart from becoming a diving instructor living in Airlie Beach and generally being warmer, nothing much has happened since my last post (Ha!).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m waiting for delivery of Â a nikon 35mm f1.8 lens (AU$299).</p>

<p>Said lens will give me a 52mm equivalent on my Nikon D80.</p>

<p>This will be one of the main projects for the foreseeable future.</p>
