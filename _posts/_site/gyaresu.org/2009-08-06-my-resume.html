<p>Well apart from a dismal rushed attempt to write a resumé in 2002 I&#8217;ve gotten along just fine without needing one.</p>

<p>The time has come though where some of the interesting jobs I want to apply for are on the other side of the world and there&#8217;s no chance to look them in the eye and shake their hand.</p>

<p>So&#8230;</p>

<p>Research. I&#8217;ve done the <a href='http://delicious.com'>http://delicious.com</a> search and found a great Rands piece <a href='http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html'>http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html</a></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a pile of good examples here: <a href='http://jobmob.co.il/blog/beautiful-resume-ideas-that-work/'>http://jobmob.co.il/blog/beautiful-resume-ideas-that-work/</a></p>

<p>So. Best get to it.</p>

<p>EDIT: The funny and talented Zed Shaw <a href='http://zedshaw.com/'>http://zedshaw.com/</a> offered his resumé template and build system in TeX.</p>

<p>It draws on using pygments and idiopidae to do the syntax  highlighting. You then use vellum to build it. Plus use tetex not latex.</p>

<p>How awesomely geeky is that for doing a resumé.</p>

<p>I really really appreciate  it when people go out of their way to help others.</p>

<p>I better go do some duty in the IRC rooms now :)</p>
