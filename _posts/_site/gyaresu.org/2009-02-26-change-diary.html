<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising, therefore, that projects tended to be behind schedule. Take a plan that&#8217;s created according to a generic formula, estimate the work in advance of any significant knowledge of requirements, have the estimates done by people who won&#8217;t be doing the work, never update the plan after work is started, and what do you get? Lousy plans&#8230; and they were treated as unquestionable truths.&#8221;</p>
