<p>&#8220;who is your greatest artisan&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the question I want to ask from the towns that I travel to.</p>

<p>The more I learn the more I realise it&#8217;s the mentors that have imparted the most knowledge. Even when they&#8217;re pompous ass&#8217;.</p>

<p>I needs me a mentor.</p>
