<p>Your aim</p>

<p>You want to use Linux and OpenSSH to automize your tasks. Therefore you need an automatic login from host A / user b to Host B / user b. You don&#8217;t want to enter any passwords, because you want to call ssh from a within a shell script. How to do it</p>

<p>First log in on A as user a and generate a pair of authentication keys. Do not enter a passphrase: a@A:~&gt; ssh-keygen -t rsa Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/a/.ssh/id_rsa): Created directory &#8216;/home/a/.ssh&#8217;. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/a/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /home/a/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 3e:4f:05:79:3a:9f:96:7c:3b:ad:e9:58:37:bc:37:e4 a@A</p>

<p>Now use ssh to create a directory ~/.ssh as user b on B. (The directory may already exist, which is fine): a@A:~&gt; ssh b@localhost mkdir -p .ssh b@localhost&#8217;s password:</p>

<p>Finally append a&#8217;s new public key to b@B:.ssh/authorized_keys and enter b&#8217;s password one last time: a@A:~&gt; cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B &#8216;cat&#160;&#187; .ssh/authorized_keys&#8217; b@B&#8217;s password:</p>

<p>From now on you can log into B as b from A as a without password: a@A:~&gt; ssh b@B hostname B</p>
