<p>Hi Matt.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve held off a month before writing you this email because I didn&#8217;t want it to come across as a personal attack.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I initially chose to go with Bluehost was because of your excellent blog.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there&#8217;s nothing that can change the way I feel now when someone mentions your company (please note again, not a personal attack).</p>

<p>Around the 19th March 2009 my bluehost account giantfriend.com was closed and all data deleted without warning or even explanation.</p>

<p>Bluehost had always been my main hosting site (around 14 websites) and I have a server in Sydney (I&#8217;m in Australia) for latency important sites.</p>

<p>This is my business and of course all of my clients relied on DNS email &amp; site hosting from me.</p>

<p>I spent the next week after this catastrophe attempting to get the account reinstated and all the sites back.</p>

<p>Although the bluehost staff are friendly and helpful there was no-one who could tell me what the problem was that caused account deletion and no-one could retrieve any backups at all.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this was a violation of the terms or a mistake or an overzealous sysadmin. My entire account was just &#8216;gone&#8217;.</p>

<p>Needless to say I was absolutely gutted and don&#8217;t need to tell you that there should have been some measures in place to protect from this now apparent &#8216;Sword of Damocles&#8217;.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge the account was using ~5GB of data &amp; serving up pretty standard php/mysql based websites. There was no file sharing or dodgy content on the server.</p>

<p>I include the first email I received as none of the subsequent emails or phone calls provided any more clarity:</p>
