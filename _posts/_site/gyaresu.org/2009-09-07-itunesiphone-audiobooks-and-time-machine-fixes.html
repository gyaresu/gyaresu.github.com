<p>Changing the media type to audiobook:</p>

<p>iPod on my iPhone 3G was removing the audiobooks I was listening to at strange times. On sync or even just plugging in the power. So a little research found that with iTunes 8 you can select a Genre then &#8216;cmd + a&#8217;&#160;&#187; right click&#160;&#187; options and change &#8220;Media Kind&#8221; to &#8220;Audiobook&#8221;. Tick &#8220;Remember Position&#8221; and &#8220;Skip when shuffling&#8221;&#160;&#187; Ok.</p>

<p>Sorted.</p>

<p>Next problem was having upgraded my drive to a 500GB 7200RPM Seagate (465GB irl) the Time Machine was showing  insufficent space on the external 500GB drive as it needed to backup 469GB.</p>

<p>Problem is that there&#8217;s only 390GB on the laptop drive. Hmmm. The internets doesn&#8217;t seem to want to help on this one either.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>Under &#8220;Options&#8221;  on the Time Machine preferences panel you can click the wee &#8221;+&#8221; button and add folders or even entire drives that you don&#8217;t want TM to backup. What I discovered was that TM isn&#8217;t really sure how much stuff you have on your internal drive until it has a crack at it. Problem is it also adds a 20% buffer to its estimation. What needed to be done was add almost all of the large folders (Applications, Users) and let it have a go at backing up the few remaining ones first. This done you go back and remove all the other folders from &#8220;Do not back up:&#8221; and let it run again. Voilá!</p>
