<p>Well I&#8217;m still living out of a backpack and the ideas of what to <em>do</em> with my life are starting to mount up.</p>

<p>What a strange position to be in. I have a couple of businesses that tick over and only require me to work from the interwebs. So now I&#8217;m physically free but can&#8217;t decide where it is I should put my person.</p>

<p>Peru and their AU$130/month iphone plans with unlimited data?</p>

<p>Australia in a campervan?</p>

<p>London and Linux sysadmin?</p>

<p>Well I was quite looking forward to Amsterdam and Greenpeace sysadmin but UK Passport office helpline for passports #fail means UK passport in 12 months. I&#8217;ll have another chat with Greenpeace then perhaps.</p>

<p>What to do till then?</p>

<p>Christof Rehage has an amazing youtube clip that is a must-see http://www.thelongestway.com</p>

<p>That&#8217;s given me the inspiration to think about walking up the eastern seaboard of Australia. I could work and walk, losing some desperately unwanted kilos.</p>

<p>Will walking be so much different to driving. I know the coastal route of Australia pretty well in that lazy hop-to-hop next-pretty-place kind of way. Have laptop will travel?</p>

<p>Do I need to get a cart built? What about charging camera/laptop/iphone?</p>

<p>Should I be doing this in Europe, South America, China, South East Asia?</p>

<p>Buggered if I know. Maybe something positive to do with the Copenhagen Climate summit?</p>

<p>Just starting to walk could be a good idea.</p>
