<p>I&#8217;ve been installing software and tweaking my main site via the iPhone today. I&#8217;m using a bunch of plugins for Wordpress and a couple of iPhone apps to assist me in controlling my content creation.</p>

<p>Mainly I just don&#8217;t want to directly submit any more of my life through places like Facebook and Twitter where I don&#8217;t even get to own it. I&#8217;m ok for now submitting still to these &#8216;free&#8217; services but only until I figure out a complimentary system.</p>

<p>I got screwed by Apple today. Seems like my new laptop hadn&#8217;t really shipped a week ago like they said. Apparently next week for sure! Muppets.</p>

<p>Till then only as many experiments as I can be bothered with on this little screen.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on doing any real work via iPhone touch screen.</p>

<p>Time for an experiment!</p>
