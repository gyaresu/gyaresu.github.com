<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot as usual about our future and the very different lives we lead as a result of technology.</p>

<p>We are not controlling our online lives. Just try accessing your old Facebook or Twitter posts.</p>

<p>Most people won&#8217;t change their current ways until there&#8217;s a reason to.</p>

<p>I endeavor to beat a path for others to follow. I know from the outset I&#8217;m not alone in this and I hope there will be critical mass to move away from these gilden cages.</p>

<p>p.s. Big shout out to future me! Flying cars yet?</p>
