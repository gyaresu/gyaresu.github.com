<p>So new house only has phone line in the kitchen. Solution: WDS using Tomato of course.</p>

<p>So now I have one wrt54g connecting to the net in PPPOE Bridge mode with a billion modem (meh, average modems).</p>

<p>And one wrt54g in my office that acts as an extension of the main one. So plug that into a switch and all the computers here in the office can connect via ethernet.</p>

<p>One more for the lounge and the movie/music server and I&#8217;m sorted.</p>
