<p>Liquid error: No such file or directory - /Users/gyaresu/programming/projects/gyaresu.org/_posts/_includes &#8230;fixing current templating system&#8230;</p>

<p>Well I was.. Until I found out that my changes to the Jekyll template file weren&#8217;t getting updated on http://gyaresu.github.com</p>

<p>So now I need to wade back into the Jekyll code and figure out what it actually <em>does</em> when it&#8217;s generating the static content.</p>

<p>I mean, the local version works fine. It&#8217;s only relying on the Github server to re-run the config and generate new static code from the templates based on the new config.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>This was meant to be easier&#8230;</p>
