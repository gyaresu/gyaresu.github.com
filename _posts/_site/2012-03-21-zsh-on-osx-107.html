<p>Installed the latest version of zsh via <a href='http://macports.org'>Macports</a>.</p>

<p>Setup of <a href='https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh'>oh-my-zsh</a> involves cloning the Github repo, picking a theme and choosing which plugins to use.</p>

<p>oh-my-zsh automatically checks for updates and pulls new versions.</p>

<p>The plugins are excellent. Rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc.</p>

<p>And zsh as usual is fantastic. Just use it to find out why.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll never want to go back to bash after using it.</p>
