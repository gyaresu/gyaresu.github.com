<p>I&#8217;ve been teaching myself JavaScript and Python for the last six months and thought now was a good time to open up my private repository hosted on <a href='http://github.com'>GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started with a fresh repo as my original private repo had too many keys &amp; mess in it.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/gyaresu/oslogigs-node'>Github repo: Oslo Gigs</a></p>

<p>You can see the working version here <a href='http://oslogigs.com'>http://oslogigs.com</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a web app for finding the price of Ã¸l (beer) in pubs and venues around Oslo, Norway.</p>

<p>It uses a Google map with numbered markers.</p>

<p>I intend to continue on it and hopefully add http://twillio.com authentication via sms so that the site is fully automated for price updates.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;re in Oslo and find the price either missing or wrong, let me know.</p>
