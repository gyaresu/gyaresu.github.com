<p>I have a resumé <a href='http://gyaresu.org/gareth_cv.txt'>http://gyaresu.org/gareth_cv.txt</a> and I have a LinkedIn profile <a href='http://no.linkedin.com/in/gyaresu'>http://no.linkedin.com/in/gyaresu</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem right to be too informal or glib in a resumé or job appliction. Maybe it&#8217;ll be ok to just link to this post? We&#8217;ll see. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this because I don&#8217;t have the benefit of &#8216;word of mouth&#8217; that I used to benefit from. Writing about one&#8217;s attributes feels so terribly narcissistic.</p>

<p>LOOK AT ME! I&#8217;M AWESOME! etc.</p>

<p><code>The fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.</code> &#8211; Bertrand Russell</p>

<p>I started my on-site computer business in 2002 after 6 months of learning to use a computer.</p>

<p>Whilst in Sydney I&#8217;d been given an old ACER laptop with a P2 CPU &#38; 32MB of RAM. That&#8217;s what I had to work with.</p>

<p>When I landed back in Launceston it was just before the 2002 Elections so I started running the campaign office for the Tasmanian Greens (something I&#8217;ve done since my 20&#8217;s).</p>

<p>I&#8217;d turn up every day and talk to people about politics in between messing with this Windows 98 laptop.</p>

<p>A week or so into this <a href='http://raywalker.it/'>Ray</a> walked in and so began a geeky friendship and lots of foot bag.</p>

<p>The great way Ray had of teaching me about computers was to literally ignore all ridiculous questions and only answer the ones that showed independent research.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s exactly the behaviour you&#8217;ll find on IRC still to this day.</p>

<p>Computers are amazing. The internet is amazing. Seriously. MIND BLOWN.</p>

<p>Ever since then I&#8217;ve been able to learn and research and ask and help and interact on so many levels about so much AMAZING information.</p>

<p>I started my business so quickly after learning to use computers for two reasons. First and foremost was that I wanted a job. Second was because I seriously thought I could help enough to be worth paying.</p>

<p>I rang all the on-site computer businesses in town and found the cheapest hourly rate was AU$28.50. So that&#8217;s what I decided to charge. I also vowed to not charge should I be unable to help a client.</p>

<p>As with any business plan one should always plan for the worst and expect the best. I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. I quickly found that I could solve every problem presented to me and because I&#8217;m a big friendly happy and helpful person, I could communicate the &#8216;why&#8217; something needed to be done.</p>

<p>Being fully informed and solving their problems meant that over the years my clients wouldn&#8217;t even want to know the options, &#8216;just do what you think is best&#8217;.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;d get all these referrals for work and even other computer businesses would either contact or recommend me for obscure stuff.</p>

<p>I became the Linux guy, and the OS X guy and the wireless networking guy and the BSD guy and the guy who figured out how to drive the programme of a whole range of bizarre, ancient, multi-tonne CNC machines.</p>

<p>GOOD FUN.</p>

<p>My hourly rate went from $28.50 &gt; $50 &gt; $55 &gt; $75 &gt; $100 &gt; $110 &gt; $150 over about four years. That&#8217;s not even including some of the cool places I&#8217;ve been flown to by the Government for remote work. Can you say junket? Sweeeet.</p>

<p>Oddly, clients are easier to deal with the more you charge. Not because they&#8217;re better people but because value for money is counter-intuitive. Clients paying $150/hr believe they are getting the best and will therefore trust you know what you&#8217;re doing. Which of course means that when one is doing charity work (as I was want to do) that you will be constantly questioned over your decisions and skills. Because obviously if you&#8217;re charging either nothing or very little then you&#8217;re value is the equivalent. Bizarre but true.</p>

<p>This period of my life was the longest spent in any one place. I was comfortable in my job but itching to see more of the world. So I sold my business. While travelling in Queensland I went out to the Great Barrier Reef on a boat with 300 hundred other people. Two years later after an apprenticeship and a LOT of excellent training from people I still greatly respect I was a senior diver, running that boat and teaching at a dozen sites in Fiji.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken a few thousand people diving and taught people who are now instructors themselves. 13hrs/day 7 days a week (with the occasional weekend off).</p>

<p>BECAUSE I&#8217;M PASSIONATE.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it really. Passion. I want you to know I&#8217;m passionate.</p>

<p>Work is a time trade-off for money. I carry no debt and live frugally enough that I never have to stay in a bad situation. That&#8217;s freedom. It also means I have the luxury of being honest. I want to get up in the morning and do things that matter. I also want to keep learning. It&#8217;s scary and frustrating and exciting but being completely ignorant of a topic makes for a fantastic rush of learning.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently contracting to work remotely on Linux servers. I can still keep doing that (hey, the money&#8217;s great) but I&#8217;d like to work with others on something special.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;d like a friendly hard working passionate man to join your organisation. Please feel free to contact me.</p>
