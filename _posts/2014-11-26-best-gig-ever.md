[Wikipedia: Alternative Nation festival - Easter long weekend 16th April 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Nation_festival)

Light rain. T-Shirt and jeans. Two rolled and dry in the wallet.

Barrier goes down, a rush to the fenced-off clearing in front of the main stages right before bands start.

They leave us there. 

Us few. Fenced in from the milieu of jumping, steaming, roiling humans around us.

50 people caught in an oasis of awesome.

*Best. Gig. Ever.*
