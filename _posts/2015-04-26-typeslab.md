It's build on a super awesome stack of awesomeness and not only gives me a solid foundation for a tool I want to build but it's a great insight into modern ECMAScript 6 (ES6) programming.

I'll follow up with a post on the tools used in this modern web stack but first a 'hat tip' to Glenn and his licencing of [TypeSlab](https://github.com/geelen/typeslab) to the [GNU Affero General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)
