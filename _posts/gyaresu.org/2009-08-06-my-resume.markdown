Well apart from a dismal rushed attempt to write a resumé in 2002 I've gotten along just fine without needing one.

The time has come though where some of the interesting jobs I want to apply for are on the other side of the world and there's no chance to look them in the eye and shake their hand.

So...

Research. I've done the [http://delicious.com](http://delicious.com) search and found a great Rands piece [http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html)

There's a pile of good examples here: [http://jobmob.co.il/blog/beautiful-resume-ideas-that-work/](http://jobmob.co.il/blog/beautiful-resume-ideas-that-work/)

So. Best get to it.

EDIT: The funny and talented Zed Shaw [http://zedshaw.com/](http://zedshaw.com/) offered his resumé template and build system in TeX.

It draws on using pygments and idiopidae to do the syntax  highlighting. You then use vellum to build it. Plus use tetex not latex.

How awesomely geeky is that for doing a resumé.

I really really appreciate  it when people go out of their way to help others.

I better go do some duty in the IRC rooms now :)
