I've been thinking a lot as usual about our future and the very different lives we lead as a result of technology.

We are not controlling our online lives. Just try accessing your old Facebook or Twitter posts.

Most people won't change their current ways until there's a reason to.

I endeavor to beat a path for others to follow. I know from the outset I'm not alone in this and I hope there will be critical mass to move away from these gilden cages.

p.s. Big shout out to future me! Flying cars yet?
