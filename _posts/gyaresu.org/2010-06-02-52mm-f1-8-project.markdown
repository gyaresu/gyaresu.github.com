So apart from becoming a diving instructor living in Airlie Beach and generally being warmer, nothing much has happened since my last post (Ha!).

I'm waiting for delivery of Â a nikon 35mm f1.8 lens (AU$299).

Said lens will give me a 52mm equivalent on my Nikon D80.

This will be one of the main projects for the foreseeable future.
