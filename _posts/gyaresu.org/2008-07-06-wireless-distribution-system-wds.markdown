So new house only has phone line in the kitchen. Solution: WDS using Tomato of course.

So now I have one wrt54g connecting to the net in PPPOE Bridge mode with a billion modem (meh, average modems).

And one wrt54g in my office that acts as an extension of the main one. So plug that into a switch and all the computers here in the office can connect via ethernet.

One more for the lounge and the movie/music server and I'm sorted.
