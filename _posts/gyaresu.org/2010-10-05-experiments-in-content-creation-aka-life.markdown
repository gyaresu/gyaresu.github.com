I've been installing software and tweaking my main site via the iPhone today. I'm using a bunch of plugins for Wordpress and a couple of iPhone apps to assist me in controlling my content creation.

Mainly I just don't want to directly submit any more of my life through places like Facebook and Twitter where I don't even get to own it. I'm ok for now submitting still to these 'free' services but only until I figure out a complimentary system.

I got screwed by Apple today. Seems like my new laptop hadn't really shipped a week ago like they said. Apparently next week for sure! Muppets. 

Till then only as many experiments as I can be bothered with on this little screen.

Don't even get me started on doing any real work via iPhone touch screen.

Time for an experiment!
