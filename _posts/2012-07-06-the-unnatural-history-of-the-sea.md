**The following is a message I got today on Facebook. You really should read this book.**

    I read the unnatural history of the sea you advised. It's seriously changed my life. The fish I eat, the things I do, buy and the causes I support. Also I think I'm a better and more appreciative diver. Great advice. I salute you 
    p.s. I've since past the book on and bought 2 more.
